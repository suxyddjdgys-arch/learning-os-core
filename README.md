# Learning OS — Core

Release: 0.4.0

This repository is the reusable Core plane for the Learning OS V0.4
separation architecture. Core content never self-asserts deployment status:
the public Runtime-Control contract is the sole authority that deploys an
exact Core commit.

The Core plane owns reusable product semantics only: the Core contract
(`config/core.yaml`, schema 0.4), protocol documents, the deterministic
validator, synthetic tests, and stable reusable domain templates. It contains
no learner state, no Evidence, no Instance or deployment authority, and no
credentials. All test fixtures are synthetic.

Validation (offline, deterministic):

    python scripts/validate_learning_os.py . --core
    python -m unittest discover -s tests -v

The V0.4-B2-B split-aware Instance surface validates a materialized Instance
snapshot against a locally materialized Core snapshot plus an explicit
synthetic trusted deployment binding:

    python scripts/validate_learning_os.py <instance> --instance \
        --core-snapshot <core> --deployment-binding <binding.yaml>

The V0.4-B2-C deployment surface validates an offline split deployment. Each
snapshot is a `RepositorySnapshot`: a materialized tree plus caller-supplied
trusted provenance (`repository_id`, and for the deployed Core the exact
pinned 40-hex `commit_sha`). Identity is never read from repository content;
missing or mismatched trusted metadata fails closed:

    python scripts/validate_learning_os.py . --deployment \
        --control-snapshot <control> \
        --core-snapshot <core> \
        --instance-snapshot <instance> \
        --locator <locator.yaml> \
        --provenance <provenance.yaml>

`validate_deployment` reuses `validate_core()` and `validate_instance()`
instead of duplicating them, enforces the allowlist-only Runtime-Control
deployment contract, and rejects Instance identity, lineage, migration
transaction, or credential content in the public contract. See
`protocol/runtime-bootstrap.md` for the trust model and explicit non-goals
(no repository resolution, no GitHub lookup, no live fetch, no platform
permission checks).

All Instance and deployment test fixtures are synthetic programmatic
temporaries; no real learner state, real Evidence, or credentials are ever
materialized.

Core mutation follows PR-required governance. This repository is not part
of any Runtime installation and is not read by any deployed runtime.
