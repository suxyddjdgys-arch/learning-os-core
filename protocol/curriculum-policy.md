# Curriculum Policy

Curriculum is reusable Domain knowledge structure. Topic/Subtopic Plans are learner-specific routes. Curriculum selection may inform a route, but curriculum nodes are not learner progress units or Subtopics by default.

Allowed high-level curriculum actions: `advance`, `deepen`, `reinforce`, `repair_prerequisite`, `branch`, `defer`.

## Priority order

1. current explicit learner question;
2. current blocker;
3. high-value ready node aligned with the Topic goal;
4. node that naturally resolves a high-value evidence gap;
5. useful integration or reinforcement;
6. valuable branch;
7. low-priority review;
8. syllabus completeness.

## Initial Topic planning

For a new learner-specific Topic, consult `new-topic-start.md`. Use learner-authoritative Goal, relevant execution constraints/preferences, background, current Knowledge State, and reusable curriculum structure to create a coarse adaptive Topic route.

Prefer a few meaningful Topic milestones and materialize only the current useful Subtopic. Do not generate a large fixed syllabus merely for completeness. A Topic Plan MAY remain `provisional` while learning begins.

Creating a Topic does not require creating a new Domain. Reuse existing curricula when possible and create/extend reusable knowledge structure only as much as current teaching needs.

## Orientation and route coherence

Curriculum structure is partly responsible for keeping teaching navigable. At Topic/Subtopic entry, and again after a material route change or learner-reported disorientation, present a compact orientation spine when useful:

- the current learner goal/milestone;
- the local upstream -> current -> downstream relation;
- the relevant system/process map at a level appropriate to the learner;
- the reason the current node is being studied now.

This is not a requirement to expose the entire curriculum graph or a fixed syllabus. The purpose is to prevent locally correct teaching from becoming an unstructured sequence of facts.

A learner-specific Plan MAY depart from curriculum suggested order, but a material departure SHOULD have a learner-relevant reason. If runtime teaching temporarily enters a later node or a side path, preserve the conceptual return path. If the departure becomes structural or persistent, replan rather than allowing silent route drift.

Curriculum edges are not only scheduler metadata: when a connection is pedagogically important, teaching SHOULD make the dependency/motivation visible in learner language instead of relying on hidden graph structure.

## Prerequisites and just-in-time learning

Missing state is unknown, not evidence of inability. Prior exposure from `learner/background.yaml` may justify a provisional starting assumption, but not capability state.

For curriculum edges:

- `requires`: treat as a hard prerequisite only when the dependency is meaningfully unsupported/conflicted and would block the target work;
- `supports`: never make it a hard blocker by itself;
- `provisional`: usually continue with caution unless failure cost/dependency importance justifies verification;
- prefer natural observation over automatic pretesting.

Use the minimum escalation required:

1. **natural observation**: unknown/background/low-risk dependency; continue and observe naturally;
2. **inline repair**: small actual blocker; repair only what is needed;
3. **prerequisite-support Subtopic**: a coherent multi-session repair that still serves the current Topic;
4. **standalone Topic**: the learner explicitly wants independent systematic study, or the scope is large/reusable enough to justify its own learning project.

Just-in-time learning SHOULD be used for local dependencies when it reduces unnecessary front-loading, but it MUST remain anchored to established knowledge. Do not casually introduce many undeclared concepts and expect the learner to identify which ones are prerequisites they should ask about.

A future curriculum object MAY be used before formal study only when the current step needs a small, declared interface. Treat the object as a black box at that interface and do not require internal knowledge that belongs to the future node. If the current work actually requires the internals, route to an appropriate repair/detour instead of hiding the dependency.

If an existing active Topic already covers the prerequisite, prefer reusing/reprioritizing it rather than creating duplicate support structure.

A `prerequisite_debt` is deferred routing knowledge, not evidence of inability. Reactivate it only when its consumer/trigger becomes relevant.

## Reusable diagnostic probes

The objective Domain structure is a good home for reusable diagnostic design, but a probe's actual diagnosticity is learner- and context-sensitive. Therefore reusable probes SHOULD be treated as **candidate anchors**, not universal mastery tests.

For high-value curriculum nodes/capabilities, a small curated probe bank or reusable probe specification MAY be maintained. Prefer sparse high-quality anchors and templates over a large undifferentiated question set.

A reusable probe specification SHOULD identify, when material:

- `target_node` and `target_capability` (for example conceptual structure, explanation, standard application, transfer, or formal derivation);
- the prompt or parameterized template;
- required prerequisites/representations/terminology beyond the target capability;
- diagnostic rationale: what distinction the probe is intended to reveal;
- known shortcuts, confounds, or alternative solution paths that can reduce diagnosticity;
- expected reasoning/rubric, not merely a final answer;
- approximate learner/flow cost and difficulty characteristics;
- useful follow-up actions for characteristic response patterns;
- provenance and licensing/usage constraints for externally sourced material.

Probe selection at runtime MUST still consider current learner Knowledge State/background, prerequisite burden, recent teaching exposure, avoid-retesting, learner cost, and the decision that the probe is supposed to inform. A Domain-level anchor can be low-diagnostic for a particular learner if an unrelated prerequisite dominates the task.

Runtime-generated probes remain valid and are often useful for adaptation, but they SHOULD satisfy the same target-capability and confound checks as curated anchors. When a high-quality reusable anchor is available and fits the learner/context, prefer it over improvising a weaker diagnostic merely for novelty.

Externally sourced questions MAY be used as candidate material, but web/source availability does not make them canonical. Before reuse, check correctness, target-capability alignment, hidden prerequisites, likely shortcuts/confounds, adaptation needs, and provenance/license. Do not bulk-ingest large scraped question sets merely to increase volume.

A reusable probe bank is Domain teaching infrastructure, not learner Evidence or Knowledge State. Answering a bank item creates no capability transition by itself; observed performance is still classified and integrated through the Evidence protocols.

Current V0.3 Core does not require every Domain to materialize a persistent probe bank. Materialize durable probe assets only when repeated teaching benefit justifies their maintenance; storage/schema may remain sparse and domain-specific until a stable core representation is warranted.

## Branching and Subtopic materialization

Classify side paths as `inline`, `short_detour`, `deep_detour`, or `defer`. Consider blocker relief, integration value, prerequisite burden, learner interest, diversion cost, and expected multi-session value.

A deep detour may become a Subtopic candidate, but candidate status does not require immediate materialization. Preserve a return point for meaningful detours.

Subtopic materialization is a Topic planning decision, not a curriculum-node transformation. Curriculum node != Subtopic != chat.

## Replanning

Replan only when the learner-specific route would materially improve, for example after:

- explicit Topic Goal or meaningful time/resource change;
- a real prerequisite blocker;
- strong evidence that planned material is redundant or too advanced;
- a valuable learner-interest branch;
- meaningful progress evidence that changes readiness;
- a structural Subtopic change or cross-Topic dependency.

Do not rewrite Topic/Subtopic Plans after ordinary turns. Progress moves without requiring Plan revision unless the route itself changes.

## Review

Do not downgrade Knowledge State solely because time passed. Review priority should consider evidence strength/age, downstream importance, lack of natural reuse opportunities, and failure cost. Prefer natural reuse in upcoming curriculum over separate review when practical.
