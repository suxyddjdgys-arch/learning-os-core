# Learning OS Runtime Bootstrap (V0.4 Split Topology)

This protocol defines how a runtime (or any caller) deterministically validates
a V0.4 split deployment offline before trusting it. It defines the validation
input model only; it does not create deployment authority and does not define
any live resolver, fetch, or permission surface.

## 1. Validation surface

    validate_deployment(control_snapshot, deployed_core, instance_snapshot, trusted_locator)

The surface composes, and MUST NOT duplicate, the two sub-surfaces:

- `validate_core(deployed_core)` — Core plane contract.
- `validate_instance(instance_snapshot, deployed_core, deployment_binding)` —
  Instance plane contract, driven by a binding projected from the validated
  contract (see §4).

## 2. RepositorySnapshot — trusted provenance

Every snapshot argument is a `RepositorySnapshot(root, repository_id, commit_sha)`:

- `repository_id` and `commit_sha` MUST come from the caller as trusted
  resolver output (for example, the platform API answer to "what did I
  actually fetch"). The validator never reads repository content as a source
  of identity: any self-declared identity inside a repository is untrusted.
- A non-integer, non-positive `repository_id` fails closed at construction.
- `commit_sha` must be a full 40-hex commit or absent; abbreviated SHAs and
  branch/tag/ref names are never valid pins.
- `deployed_core` additionally requires the exact pinned `commit_sha`
  (missing provenance fails closed).
- The trusted locator (§3) and snapshot provenance are cross-checked; a
  mismatch is a trust failure, not a warning.

## 3. Trusted locator — external trust root

The locator is the single external trust root:

    runtime_control:
      repository_id   # security identity (positive integer)
      repository      # navigation only, never trusted
      canonical_ref   # navigation only
      contract_path   # where the public contract lives (default deployment.yaml)
    instance:
      repository_id   # security identity
      repository      # navigation only

`contract_path` is a repository-relative POSIX file path inside the materialized
Runtime-Control snapshot. It MUST remain contained by that snapshot and MUST NOT
use absolute/traversal/backslash path forms or traverse symlinks.

Instance identity lives only in the locator. The public Runtime-Control
contract MUST NOT carry Instance identity, lineage fields, migration
transaction fields, or credentials.

## 4. Deployment contract and binding

The public Runtime-Control contract (`deployment.yaml`) is allowlist-only:

- top-level keys: `schema_version`, `document_type`, `updated_at`,
  `deployment`, `core`.
- `deployment`: `id`, `topology` (`split`), `epoch` (positive integer
  fencing token), `write_state` (`active` | `frozen`).
- `core`: `repository_id`, `commit` (exact 40-hex), optional
  `repository_full_name` (navigation only).

Failures — missing contract, wrong `schema_version`/`document_type`, unknown
fields at any level, non-integer IDs, abbreviated SHA or ref-name pin,
identity mismatch against locator/provenance, Instance identity, lineage,
migration, or credential/token content — are all errors (fail closed).

`DeploymentBinding` has exactly two forms and no second schema:

1. `synthetic` — the fixture form (full 7-key mapping or YAML file,
   `context_type: synthetic`), the only form accepted by the standalone
   `validate_instance` surface.
2. `contract` — a projection built from an already structurally validated
   contract plus the trusted locator. `validate_deployment` uses this form;
   deployment authority stays in the contract validator, never in the
   binding.

## 5. Bootstrap order

1. Materialize the three snapshots offline (exact commits; caller records
   provenance from the resolver it used).
2. Obtain the trusted locator from the deployment authority.
3. Run `validate_deployment`; only an error-free result may be treated as a
   validated deployment candidate.

## 6. Explicit non-goals

This surface MUST NOT include `resolve_repository()`, `lookup_github()`,
`fetch_live_deployment()`, or `check_platform_permissions()`. Fetching,
resolution, permissions, epoch enforcement, and write-state routing belong to
future resolver/runtime surfaces. Validation here is deterministic, offline,
and structural; it is not complete secret detection.

## 7. Current status

All planes remain NONCANONICAL and NOT DEPLOYED. Production remains
`learning-os` release 0.3.2 (topology LEGACY). Nothing in this protocol
authorizes migration, activation, promotion, freeze, rehearsal, or cutover.
